# Introduction
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array where the numbers at the edges are always 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. This project defines a Python function pascal_triangle(n) that generates n rows of Pascal's Triangle.

# How Pascal's Triangle Works
Each row in Pascal's Triangle starts and ends with the number 1. Each interior number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it in the previous row. For example, the 5th row [1, 4, 6, 4, 1] can be derived by adding the elements from the 4th row [1, 3, 3, 1].

Hereâ€™s the structure for the first few rows:

       1
      1 1
     1 2 1
    1 3 3 1
   1 4 6 4 1

# Function Overview
The function pascal_triangle(n) generates Pascal's Triangle up to n rows.

Function Signature
python
def pascal_triangle(n):
    """
    Generates a Pascal's Triangle with n rows.

    Parameters:
    n (int): Number of rows to generate

    Returns:
    List of lists: A list of lists representing the triangle's rows
    """
# Parameters
n: An integer representing the number of rows of the triangle to generate.
Return
The function returns a list of lists, where each inner list corresponds to a row in Pascal's Triangle.
Usage
To use the function, you can call it in a Python script after importing or defining it.

Example:
python
from pascal_triangle import pascal_triangle

# Generate 5 rows of Pascal's Triangle
triangle = pascal_triangle(5)
print(triangle)
Output:
css

[[1],
 [1, 1],
 [1, 2, 1],
 [1, 3, 3, 1],
 [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]
